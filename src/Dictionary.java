/*You are to a write a program which asks a user to enter 10 words.
Save these words in an array.  Using the bubble sort algorithm (see below),
 sort the words in an ascending order. For the output, print out the words in the original order,
 in the ascending order, and in the descending order.
 Finally, print an array where all letters have been changed to uppercase.
  Don't forget to write a pseudocode or flowchart BEFORE writing your code.
